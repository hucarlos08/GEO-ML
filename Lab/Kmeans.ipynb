    "## Implementing K-means++ with JAX\n",
    "\n",
    "JAX is a library for high-performance numerical computing in Python, with strong support for GPU acceleration and automatic differentiation. It's particularly well-suited for implementing algorithms like K-means++ due to its ability to parallelize operations and utilize GPU capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key JAX Features for K-means++\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **jit compilation**: Just-in-time compilation of functions for faster execution.\n",
    "2. **vmap**: Vectorized map for automatic parallelization across batch dimensions.\n",
    "3. **jax.random**: For generating random numbers on GPU.\n",
    "4. **jnp**: JAX's NumPy-compatible array library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Initialize First Centroid**:\n",
    "   - Use `jax.random.choice` to select the first centroid randomly.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distance Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Implement a JAX function to compute pairwise distances between points and centroids.\n",
    "   - Use `jax.vmap` to vectorize this operation across all points.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Probability Calculation**:\n",
    "   - Compute the squared distances and normalize to get probabilities.\n",
    "   - Use JAX's efficient array operations for this step.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Centroid Selection**:\n",
    "   - Implement cumulative sum and binary search for selecting centroids based on calculated probabilities.\n",
    "   - Use `jax.lax.while_loop` for an efficient implementation of the selection process.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **K-means Iterations**:\n",
    "   - Implement the standard K-means algorithm using JAX operations.\n",
    "   - Use `jax.lax.fori_loop` for efficient looping in JAX.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Potential Challenges and Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random Sampling**: JAX's random number generation is stateless, which requires careful handling of PRNGKeys.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **GPU Memory Management**: For very large datasets, you may need to implement batching to avoid GPU memory limitations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Numerical Stability**: Use JAX's `jnp.finfo(jnp.float32).eps` to avoid division by zero in probability calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Performance Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **JIT Compilation**: Use `@jax.jit` decorator on key functions to compile them for faster execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Precision vs Speed**: Consider using `jnp.float32` instead of `jnp.float64` for faster computations, if the precision is acceptable for your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Batching**: For very large datasets, implement a batched version of the algorithm to process subsets of the data at a time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Code Structure\n",
